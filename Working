Working of this fingerprint attendance system project is fairly simple.
First of all, the user needs to enrol fingerprints of the user with the help of push buttons.
To do this, user need to press ENROLL key and then LCD asks for entering ID for the fingerprint to save it in memory by ID name. 
So now user needs to enter ID by using UP/DOWN keys. After selecting ID, user 42
needs to press OK key (DEL key). Now LCD will ask to place finger over the fingerprint module.
Now user needs to place his finger over finger print module and then the module takes finger image.
Now the LCD will say to remove finger from fingerprint module, and again ask to place finger again.
Now user needs to put his finger again and module takes an image and convert it into templates and stores it by selected ID into the finger print moduleâ€™s memory.
Now the user will be registered and he/she can feed attendance by putting their finger over fingerprint module.
By the same method, all the users will be registered into the system.
Now if the user wants to remove or delete any of the stored ID or fingerprint, then he/she need to press DEL key. 
Once delete key is pressed LCD will ask to select ID that need to be deleted. Now user needs to select ID and press OK key (same DEL key).
Now LCD will let you know that fingerprint has been deleted successfully.
